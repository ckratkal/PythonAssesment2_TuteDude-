Module 3: Control Structures in Python

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
**File:EvenOdd.py**
- The user is asked to enter a number.
- The program checks if the number is divisible by 2:
- If num % 2 == 0, it prints "{num} is an even number."
- Otherwise, it prints "{num} is an odd number."
- The program then prints "Thank you" before ending.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
**File:SumOfInt.py**
- The program prompts the user to input two numbers: start and end.
- It checks whether end is greater than start:
    - If true, it sums all numbers from start to end (excluding end).
    - If false, it displays an error message and asks for valid input.
- The final sum is printed.
